Running Time in Algorithms:

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst case, 
where "n" is the number of elements in the array. This is because, for each element, 
it may need to traverse the entire sorted portion of the array to find its correct position.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(1) because it 
performs sorting in-place, i.e., it doesn't use any additional data structures 
whose size depends on the input size. The algorithm uses only a constant amount 
of extra space for variables like key, j, and shifts.
